The SKA-low observatory aims to use 512 stations of 256 antenna phased array to perform the next level of radio frequency astronomical observations. This most recent Aperture Array Verification System, AAVS3, operates a regular sunflower head ‘Vogel’ layout design [1]. Using method-of-moments simulations of these stations, including mutual coupling, we observe a blind spot at zenith of the embedded element pattern (EEP) at 125 MHz [2], corresponding to a drop in power of around 5 dB.
