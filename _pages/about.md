### About Me

My research focuses on understanding and mitigating the challenges posed by instrumental effects in radio interferometry, with a particular emphasis on the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), the most ambitious radio telescope ever conceived. My work spans the study of electromagnetic interactions within array elements, the influence of cable system design on signal propagation, and the investigation of solar flare impacts on the Earth's ionosphere. By leveraging advanced simulation tools and developing end-to-end models, my research aims to enhance the fidelity of radio astronomical observations, thereby enabling breakthroughs in cosmology, solar physics, and the study of the early universe.

A significant portion of my recent work has been dedicated to understanding the effects of Mutual Coupling (MC) on the SKA-Low radio telescope. The presence of MC—where electromagnetic fields from adjacent antennas interfere with each other—can distort the station beam patterns and affect the telescope’s visibility measurements. In two recent studies (2024), I explored how MC alters the time-delay power spectrum, especially in the context of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) signal. Using the Fast Array Simulation Tool (FAST) and OSKAR, I demonstrated that MC introduces significant leakage of bright foreground signals into longer delays, thereby obscuring the faint 21-cm signal sought by cosmologists. Importantly, I showed that even with attempts to correct for these effects using approximated or interpolated beam models, the residual contamination remains orders of magnitude higher than the EoR signal. This finding underscores the need for highly precise beam models with fine spectral resolution, a critical consideration for SKA's data processing pipelines.

Complementing this work, I conducted a follow-up investigation on the visibility time-delay impulse response for various array layouts (regular, sunflower, and random) of the SKA-Low core. This analysis revealed that MC broadens the delay spread across station layouts, with the most pronounced effects observed in regular arrays. These insights highlight the computational and signal-processing challenges associated with modeling MC effects for large-scale radio telescopes and have significant implications for the detection of cosmological 21-cm signals.

Beyond the impact of MC, I have also explored the influence of impedance mismatches in coaxial transmission lines used in SKA-Low's analog signal chain. My 2024 work developed an end-to-end simulation pipeline that incorporated realistic scattering parameters of transmission lines, linking mismatches in impedance to chromatic aberrations in the instrument bandpass. By combining a comprehensive sky model of foregrounds with a 21-cm cosmological brightness temperature cube, I demonstrated how even minor deviations in cable length (as small as 0.1%) could introduce contamination that leaks into the EoR window. This result emphasizes the necessity for precision engineering in cable design, as even minimal inconsistencies can compromise the detectability of the EoR signal.

My broader research interests also extend to ionospheric science, where I have investigated the D-region's response to solar flares. My 2021 study presented a large-scale statistical analysis of 334 solar flare events using very-low-frequency (VLF) radio wave measurements in combination with GOES X-ray data. I established a linear relationship between the VLF amplitude and X-ray flux, while also showing that the D-region's response is independent of the solar disk position of the flare. Notably, for higher-energy hard X-rays observed with RHESSI, I found that some events exhibited negative time delays, revealing a previously underexplored interplay between flare energy bands and the Earth's ionospheric response. This research provides critical insights for understanding space weather impacts on the Earth's atmospheric layers and informs the development of predictive ionospheric models.

In summary, my research seeks to solve fundamental and technical challenges in radio interferometry, from mitigating MC effects and cable-induced signal distortions in SKA-Low to understanding ionospheric responses to space weather. Through advanced modeling, large-scale simulations, and rigorous statistical analysis, I aim to provide the radio astronomy community with tools and methods that will enable the detection of faint cosmological signals and enhance our understanding of the early universe.

Beyond the technical side, I believe in the power of clear communication and collaboration in science. Sharing ideas, fostering curiosity, and working with others to solve complex problems are core to my approach.
